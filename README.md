# FUTURE_DS_01
This project provides a comprehensive Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python. The main goal is to uncover insights about the passengers on board, such as survival rates across different demographics (gender, age groups, class) and investigate patterns influencing survival outcomes.
# Titanic Data Analysis: Data Cleaning and EDA with Python

Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring the famous Titanic dataset. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, I performed data cleaning tasks, handled missing values, and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize survival trends based on gender, age, class, and other factors.

Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy
Project Workflow
Data Cleaning:
Removed unnecessary columns like Cabin due to high numbers of missing values.
Addressed missing values in the Age and Embarked columns to ensure data accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Created visualizations for passenger demographics.
Analyzed survival rates based on class, gender, and age.
Investigated relationships between fare and survival likelihood.
Key Findings
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
Class: Passengers in first class had higher survival rates, while those in third class faced the greatest risk.
Age: Younger passengers, especially children, showed higher survival rates.
How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Data-Analysis.git
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and visualizations.
Future Improvements
Apply machine learning models to predict survival chances.
Expand visualizations to include interactive elements with Plotly.
